# Introduction

This was an assignment by Ethlas. Task was to use 1 of the API that they given and create an app using NextJs.
I have choose the StarWars API aka [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/documentation).

I realized that not a lot of people knew about StarWars so i have decided to use this API and create an app where users can find out more information of the characters, flims and vehicles



# Features:

- User is able to login using a dummy account (Username:test Password: test)

# Reflection

I started on 15/4/2022 as it is Good Firday. Started off with doing basic mockups and research on next js. Decided to work on backend as there isn't really a requirement to do backend. However, after setting up, i realized that i am able to login, however, the cookie isn't generated. I still have to research if this is related to passport local or NextJs works differently from React. Continue working on the routes and started to setup the layout.

Saturday, i decided to focus on the frontend. Was really a recap for me as i haven't touch Javascript for 2 months. 

I really like how NextJS is designed. Previously in React, i have to use React Router, however there is router here that is set up for you which makes things pretty easy. However, i realized that i haven't really use a lot of NextJs features as it requires me to play around to understand the features well. This is also my first time using Chakra UI as a framework. Chakra UI was pretty straight forward. I like how they design their styling and their components. I might use it again in the future.

Overall,I managae to complete the assignment and i'm very happy that i was given the chance to do this. This is the first techincal take home assignment in my carrer. Whatever the outcome is, i really did learn from it.
